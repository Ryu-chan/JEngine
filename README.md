JEngine (Java based engine)
==========

About
----------
This is as the name states, a Java based engine which may be used for creating games and applications in Java.  The engine is for all intents and purposed complete and may be used as is - though you may want to add too it as you see fit.  All files are properly JavaDoc'ed so you may compile the Docs from it.

Also note this engine supports FSEM, page-flipping, double buffering, and hardware acceleration - you do not need to worry about these options they will be handled for you.

This project has recently taken the back burner to my OpenGL project GLLIB (see my repositories) and I do plan to return to it and flesh it out a bit more.
